# DNS Agent - The Intelligence Shield 🛡️🚀

DNS Agent is not just a DNS server; it is a **synchronized security and intelligence engine**. By combining network-level DNS sinkholing with a surgical browser-side intelligence hub, it offers a level of network control and data ownership previously reserved for high-end enterprise suites.

## 🏗️ The Hybrid Architecture
Unlike traditional blockers that live only in the browser or only on the router, DNS Agent uses a **dual-engine approach** to ensure zero-leakage protection.
