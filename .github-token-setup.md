# GitHub Token Setup for Automated Releases

## Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give it a name: `DNS Agent Release Publisher`
4. Set expiration: **No expiration** (or your preference)
5. Select scopes:
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
     - This includes: repo:status, repo_deployment, public_repo, repo:invite, security_events
6. Click **"Generate token"**
7. **COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY** (you won't see it again!)

## Step 2: Save the Token Securely

### Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)
```powershell
# Set for current session
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_your_token_here"

# Set permanently (Windows)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GITHUB_TOKEN', 'ghp_your_token_here', 'User')
```

### Option B: Pass as Parameter
```powershell
.\Publish-Release.ps1 -GitHubToken "ghp_your_token_here"
```

## Step 3: Run the Release Script

```powershell
# Make sure you've built the release first
.\Build-Release.ps1

# Publish to GitHub
.\Publish-Release.ps1 -Version "1.3"
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **NEVER commit your token to Git!**
- The token is like a password
- Keep it secret
- Regenerate if compromised

✅ **Token is already in .gitignore**
- `.env` files are ignored
- `.github-token-setup.md` is for reference only
