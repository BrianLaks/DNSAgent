# 📺 SmartTube & Android Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install [SmartTube](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube) on your Android device (TV, Phone, or Tablet) and integrate it with your DNS Agent for ad-blocking and watch history synchronization.

## 🚀 Why SmartTube?
Official YouTube apps on Android TVs and mobile devices often have "hardcoded" ad delivery that standard DNS blocking cannot touch. **SmartTube** is an open-source, third-party client that:
- Blocks all YouTube ads.
- Features built-in [SponsorBlock](https://sponsorblock.org/) support.
- Supports high-resolution playback (4K/8K).
- **Note**: While SmartTube blocks ads perfectly, it *cannot* report watch history to the DNS Agent dashboard due to platform limitations.

## 🛠️ Step 1: Installation (Bypassing Google Blockers)

Google Play Protect often flags third-party YouTube clients as "Harmful" because they circumvent ad revenue. To install, you must explicitly allow "Unknown Sources".

1. **Download the APK**: Download the latest stable APK directly from the [SmartTube GitHub](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/releases).
2. **Transfer to Device**: Use a USB drive or a "Send Files to TV" app to get the APK onto your device.
3. **Handle Play Protect**:
   - When you open the APK, you may see a "Blocked by Play Protect" warning.
   - Click **Install Anyway** (or click "More Details" -> "Install Anyway").
4. **Allow Unknown Sources**:
   - If prompted, go to **Settings > Security > Unknown Sources** (or "Install unknown apps").
   - Find your file manager or browser in the list and toggle it to **Allowed**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Security Context**: SmartTube is a widely trusted community project with over 40k stars on GitHub. However, you should always [decide for yourself](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/issues) if you are comfortable with third-party software.
